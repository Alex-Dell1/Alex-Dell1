## Who am I? ##

Hello there! I am **Alex Della Schiava**, a clumsy Italian guy passionate about Computer Science and Sports. I am 24 and currently working my way through a **MsC in Artificial Intelligence & Cybersecurity** at both the universities of Udine and Klagenfurt (it's an International Double Degree programme).<br><br>
I have been studying Computer Science for a good part of my life, and I do not intend to stop anytime soon (I still intend to complete my studies though!).<br>
I moved my first steps into this amazing field in High School, where I've learned (pretty well I'd say) how to code and also some of the main results
concerning theoretical computer science. I will never be thankful enough for what High School offered me, thanks to a vast 


As I finished High School, my University journey started. I first enrolled into a Bachelor's Degree in Web and Multimedia Technologies. As different as it may sound from "pure Computer Science", it still allowed me to deepen my knowledge into the field but with the aim slightly shifted towards the Web. During these years I was unsure about many things but one: I liked coding, and that's exactly what I was able to do during these years.<br>

## My interests ##
I tend to be interested in anything that is somehow involved with Computer Science. Between all those topics, Logic programming, Quantum Computing and Computational Complexity are definitely on the top of the list.

## What will you find here ##
Here, you'll find some of the university projects I am most proud of. I hope you can find them in any way useful and/or interesting. If there is something which doesn't quite convince you or for any other reason, feel free to contact me!
