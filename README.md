## Who am I? ##

Hello there! I am **Alex Della Schiava**, a clumsy Italian guy passionate about Computer Science and Sports. I am 24 and currently working my way through a **MsC in Artificial Intelligence & Cybersecurity** at both the universities of Udine and Klagenfurt (it's an International Double Degree programme).<br>
I have been studying Computer Science for a good part of my life, and I do not intend to stop anytime soon (I still intend to complete my studies though!).

## My interests ##
I am always happy to dive into anything new, even if only partly related to Computer Science. However, if I really had to make a list of my interests, it would definitely include:
- Logic Programming;
- Constraint Programming;
- Artificial General Intelligence;
- Quantum Computing; 
- Computational Complexity.

## What will you find here ##
Here, you'll find some of my university projects I am most proud of. I hope you can find them in any way useful and/or interesting. If there is something which doesn't quite convince you or for any other reason, feel free to contact me!
