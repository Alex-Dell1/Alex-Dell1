## Who am I? ##

Hello there! I am **Alex Della Schiava**, a clumsy Italian guy passionate about Computer Science and Sports. I am 24 and currently working my way through a **MsC in Artificial Intelligence & Cybersecurity** at both the universities of Udine and Klagenfurt (it's an International Double Degree programme).

### Computer Science and Me: An Unrequested Tale ###

I have been studying Computer Science for a good part of my life, and I do not intend to stop anytime soon (I still intend to complete my studies though!).<br>
I moved my first steps into this amazing field in High School, where I got quite confident with the art of coding. I had the chance to learn a variety of programming languages, in particular, I became very familiar with Python and HTML/PHP.<br>
During these years I've also learned some results concerning theoretical computer science, but I was not ready for those (_yet..._).<br><br>

As I finished High School, my University journey started. I enrolled into a Bachelor's Degree in Web and Multimedia Technologies at the University of Udine. At the time, all I knew was that I liked coding and I wanted to do more of it and better than ever before.<br>
It didn't take too long for my expectations to be mercilessly crushed: all my freshman courses were related to maths or communication. "It's all right, no worries, it's probably just the introductory part!", NOPE! Theoretical courses kept on coming. The only ones I used to find interesting were about theoretical computer science, although everytime the same question would pop up: "how are these things in any way useful?". 

A couple of years went by and I was finding the subjects of my course less and less stimulating. Yes, I was coding and that was okay, but I wasn't really improving as a programmer either.  I felt like all was left to learn was a bunch of libraries which I would eventually forget 3 months after. And so I spent my last Bachelor's year wondering: what do I actually like doing?<br>

As difficult as such a question might sound, it didn't feel overwhelming, I was somehow able to face it with positivity. The search for an answer brought me to a decision: I would dive into any opportunity came to me and, if none came, I would somehow create one. It felt amazing, even when those opportunities weren't that exciting I could still feel the thrill of exploration. Sure, it did require some discipline since any project you commit to must be completed, also the ones that you dislike. Eventually I learned that the question "What do I actually like doing?" has many good answers but not a _definitive_ one. It's a question that I will probably ask myself every day

This time of insecurity helped me grow and it didn't really overwhelm me, somehow I was able to live this phase in a positive way. I decided that I would dive into anything that came to me, waiting for that one thing that would make me go crazy. One thing I learned is that this obsessive search for passions is itself something you can get passionate about. Yeah, sometimes it feels frustrating, but that's  
It took me some time, but I slowly realized that all those theoretical courses I _had to take_ at the beginning of my Bachelor's perhaps deserved to be reconsidered. Since I was a kid, I always loved to solve math problems just for the sake of it, I hated having the solutions being handed to me. That same enthusiasm had been with me all along, even during those theoretical courses. I would get excited learning knew results, but perhaps I was too insecure to deal with _that question_: "How is this ever going to be useful for you?". I had no answer to it

## My interests ##
One the top of the list there definitely are Logic programming, Quantum Computing and Computational Complexity.<br>
Anyway, I love anything that's new, 


## What will you find here ##
Here, you'll find some of the university projects I am most proud of. I hope you can find them in any way useful and/or interesting. If there is something which doesn't quite convince you or for any other reason, feel free to contact me!
