## Who am I? ##

Hello there! I am **Alex Della Schiava**, a clumsy Italian guy passionate about Computer Science and Sports. I am 24 and currently working my way through a **MsC in Artificial Intelligence & Cybersecurity** at both the universities of Udine and Klagenfurt (it's an International Double Degree programme).

### Computer Science and me ###

I have been studying Computer Science for a good part of my life, and I do not intend to stop anytime soon (I still intend to complete my studies though!).<br>
I moved my first steps into this amazing field in High School, where I got quite confident with the art of coding. I had the chance to learn a variety of programming languages, in particular, I became very familiar with Python and HTML/PHP.<br>
During these years I've also learned some results concerning theoretical computer science, but I was not ready for those (_yet..._).<br><br>

As I finished High School, my University journey started. I enrolled into a Bachelor's Degree in Web and Multimedia Technologies at the University of Udine.<br>
As previously mentioned, I still wasn't ready for "pure" Computer Science, I didn't dislike it, but I struggled understanding what was the point behind it, I remember many people posing the same question: when am I ever gonna use this stuff in the future? So this course choice allowed to still learn some of its results but with the idea of focussing more onto practical skills, more specifically web development.<br>

A couple of years went by and I was finding the subjects of my course less and less stimulating. Yes, I was coding and that was okay, but I wasn't really improving as a programmer either. I felt like all there was left to learn was a bunch of corporate guidelines to make my code look better to others. I didn't quite care about it. And so I spent my last bachelor's year questioning myself: what do I actually like doing?<br>

It took me some time, but I slowly realized that all those theoretical courses I _had to take_ at the beginning of my Bachelor's perhaps deserved to be reconsidered. Since I was a kid, I always loved to solve math problems just for the sake of it, and I hated having the solutions _handed_ to me. That same enthusiasm had been with me all along, even during those theoretical courses. I would get excited learning knew results, but perhaps I was too insecure to deal with _that question_: "How is this ever going to be useful for you?". I had no answer to it

## My interests ##
I tend to be interested in anything that is somehow involved with Computer Science. Between all those topics, Logic programming, Quantum Computing and Computational Complexity are definitely on the top of the list.

## What will you find here ##
Here, you'll find some of the university projects I am most proud of. I hope you can find them in any way useful and/or interesting. If there is something which doesn't quite convince you or for any other reason, feel free to contact me!
