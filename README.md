## Who am I? ##

Hello there! I am **Alex Della Schiava**, a clumsy Italian guy passionate about Computer Science and Sports. I am 24 and currently working my way through a **MsC in Artificial
Intelligence & Cybersecurity** at both the universities of Udine and Klagenfurt (it's an International Double Degree programme).<br><br>
I have been studying Computer Science for a good part of my life, and I do not intend to stop anytime soon (I still intend to complete my studies though!).
I moved my first steps into this amazing field in High School, where I've learned (pretty well I'd say) how to code and also some of the main results
concerning theoretical computer science.<br>
